# Welcome into my space!👋

Ever since I was a student, I’ve been enthralled by AI and its boundless potential to tackle real-world challenges. Now, I’m more
energized than ever to explore cutting-edge innovations like LLMs and turn bold ideas into tangible breakthroughs. And when
I’m not diving deep into data, I’m training to become a plane pilot in my free time, eager to capture and share breathtaking
aerial journeys on video. Ready to soar higher together?
