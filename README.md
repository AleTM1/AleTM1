# Welcome into my space!ðŸ‘‹
Hello everyone, I'm **Alessandro Maggio a PhD Researcher in AI**, and I've been working with every piece of technology since I was a kid.  In December 2022 I completed the **Artificial Intelligence** MSc at the **University of Bologna** with a GPA of 4.0/4.0 during an Intern program at Ferrari, studying both traditional and very innovative AI techniques like Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Optimization Methods and the mathematics behind these. In 2020 I graduated with a GPA of 4.0/4.0 at the **University of Florence** in **Computer Engineering** with a thesis about Smart Industry and IoT.

I love **motorsport** and I work with several colleagues to build a full-autonomous racing car for the Formula SAE competition. My dream is putting togheter what I like studying and my passion for the automotive field. Maybe one day a Driverless F1? In any case I'm always excited by new challenges in uncharted paths, no matters the field of application.

# Technologies I feel confident with!
### A background as Computer Engineering joined to an AI specialist profile pushed me to learn different Langagues:
* C/C++
* Python
* Java
* Scala
* JavaScript
* LaTeX (well, is a sort of language)
### Some important frameworks and libraries I feel confindent with:
* NumPy
* Pandas
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* SciKit Learn
* OpenCV
* OpenMP
### And other relevant platforms and tools:
* Google Analytics
* Google Cloud Platform
* Amazon Web Services
* Docker
* Git/GitHub


# Driverless vehicle development skills
**A bit of everything!** As Division Manager I have to understand the technologies behind each aspect of the car. From a simulation environment like Gazebo to **MatLab** for the Control System, from communication protocols to **embedded systems** programming (like ROS insights!).


# Other things...
I always enjoy learning new tools and diving into new fields. More technologies you know, more problems you can solve!
