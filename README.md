# Welcome into my space!ðŸ‘‹
Hello everyone, I'm **Alessandro Maggio**, and I've been working with every piece of technology since I was a kid. In 2020 I graduated with a grade of 110/110 cum laude at the **University of Florence** in **Computer Engineering** with a thesis on Smart Industry and IoT. I'm currently enrolled at the second year of the **Artificial Intelligence** MSc at the **University of Bologna**, studying traditional and very innovative AI techniques like Neural Networks, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Optimization Methods and the mathematics behind these.

I love **motorsport** and I work with several colleagues to build a full-autonomous racing car for the Formula SAE competition. My dream is putting togheter what I like studying and my passion for the automotive field. Maybe one day a Driverless F1?

# Technologies I feel confident with!
### A background as Computer Engineering joined to an Artificial Intelligence speliacist pushed me to learn different Langagues:
* C
* C++
* Java
* Python
* Scala
* JavaScript
* LaTeX (well, is a sort of language)
### And also learning many important framework and libraries:
* NumPy
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* Pandas 
* SciKit Learn
* OpenCV
* ROS
* Docker


# Driverless development skills
**A bit of everything!** As Division Manager I have to understand the technologies behind each aspect of the car. From a simulation environment like Gazebo to **MatLab** for the Control System, from communication protocols to **embedded systems** programming.


# Other things...
I always enjoy learning new tools and diving into new fields. More technologies you know, more problems you can solve!

Feel free to contact me :smirk:
